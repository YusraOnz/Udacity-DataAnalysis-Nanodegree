The `attribSize()` helped me audit the size of the keys and gave me a hint of what attriutes are more frequent or important.

For example: country code used to be 2-digits with this format (0X), but it's changed to 3-digits following this format (01X). Another reason for phone numbers inconsistencies is the flexibility writing the country codes in different formats( 966, +966, 00966) or not writing it at all. The same situation applies to area code where it's optional to write it. The following are the six categories of phone number inconsistencies and exapmles of each: \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The Riyadh OSM was and still is full of problems possibly due to the fact that the map is created by volunteers. The major problem found in this region was language inconsistencies as both Arabic and English are used alternatively. To meet with the project scope, I worked to solve some of the problems which are street types, names case and phone numbers inconsistencies. One of the challenges I faced is to find easy and programatical ways to clean unstructured problems. For example, Riyadh's street names and places don't have a unified format or structure like some other countries does.Hence, cleaning it programatically is a big challenge. Moreover, there is a huge room of improvement and future work. For example, knowing that OSM attribute names are predefined, errors attribute names can be detected by comparing it to the list of the predefined attributes. This list is actually extracted and published in the internet. A possible difficulty with this solution is to optimize the code in terms of running time since the number of comarision needed is large.  Another possible improvement is to utilize the high accuracy of google translate API in detecting language type, misspeled words and words translation to resolve language inconsistencied. PyEnchant API can also be used to find missplellings while fuzzywuzzy API can be used to correct such word. The issue with this solution is that NLP API's are not 100% accurate and result in errors itself. However, this solution might not eliminate the problem, but it greatly reduces it."
